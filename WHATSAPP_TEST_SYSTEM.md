## Overview
A complete implementation of a WhatsApp-based test delivery system for SEC knowledge assessment. The system provides instant identity verification through personalized links, secure test administration, and comprehensive result tracking.

## 🚀 Key Features

### For SECs (Test Takers)
- **Instant Access**: Click WhatsApp link → Auto-verification → Start test
- **No Login Required**: Token-based authentication via URL parameter
- **Progressive Test Interface**: One question at a time with no back navigation
- **Real-time Timer**: 15-minute countdown with auto-submission
- **Immediate Results**: Score displayed instantly upon completion
- **Cheat Prevention**: Browser warnings, session management, and navigation restrictions

### For Admins
- **Comprehensive Dashboard**: View all test submissions with filtering and sorting
- **Real-time Statistics**: Pass rates, average scores, and completion times
- **Excel Export**: Full test results export with detailed analytics
- **Proctoring Flags**: Track potentially suspicious submissions

## 📁 File Structure

```

```

## 🔗 URL Format

WhatsApp links follow this format:
```
https://yourdomain.com/test?secId=ABC123
```

Where `secId` is the unique identifier for each SEC.

## 🎯 Test Configuration

- **Duration**: 15 minutes (configurable in `TestPage.tsx`)
- **Questions**: 10 multiple-choice questions (expandable in `testData.ts`)
- **Pass Score**: 60% (configurable in admin dashboard)
- **Categories**: Sales Strategy, Customer Service, Process Knowledge, Calculations

## 💾 Data Storage

Currently uses localStorage for development. For production:
- Replace localStorage calls with API endpoints
- Implement proper backend authentication
- Add database persistence for test results

## 🛠 Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the System**
   
   **Option A: Direct URL**
   - Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/test?secId=TEST123`
   - Complete the test to see the full flow
   
   **Option B: Add Sample Data**
   - Open browser console
   - Copy and run the function from `scripts/populate-test-data.js`
   - Login as admin and view "Test Results" from the actions menu

## 🔧 Usage Flow

2. Generate personalized WhatsApp links for each SEC
3. Send links via WhatsApp (automated or manual)

### 2. SEC Test Experience
1. Click WhatsApp link
2. Automatic identity verification
3. Test starts immediately with timer
4. Answer questions one by one (no going back)
5. Auto-submission at completion or time limit
6. Immediate score display

### 3. Admin Review
1. Access "Test Results" from admin actions menu

3. Filter by pass/fail status
4. Export results to Excel

## 📊 Sample Questions

The system includes 10 sample questions covering:

- **Sales Strategy**: Customer needs, upselling, objection handling
- **Customer Service**: Complaints, relationship building, first impressions
- **Process Knowledge**: Documentation, ID verification, requirements
- **Calculations**: Commission calculations

Questions can be easily modified in `src/lib/testData.ts`.

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Token Validation**: Each secId is validated before test access
- **Session Management**: Prevents multiple simultaneous attempts
- **Browser Protection**: Warns against page refresh and navigation
- **Time Enforcement**: Automatic submission when time expires
- **No Back Navigation**: Prevents answer changes after submission

## 📈 Analytics & Reporting

The admin dashboard provides:
- Total submissions count
- Average score across all tests
- Pass rate (≥60%)
- Average completion time
- Individual submission details
- Excel export functionality

## 🚀 Production Deployment

For production use:

1. **Backend Integration**
   - Replace localStorage with API calls
   - Implement proper JWT token validation
   - Add database persistence

2. **WhatsApp Integration**
   - Use WhatsApp Business API for link distribution
   - Implement automated scheduling

3. **Enhanced Proctoring**
   - Add webcam monitoring (optional)
   - Browser focus detection
   - Screenshot capture on suspicious activity

## 🧪 Testing

To test the complete system:

1. Start the dev server
2. Navigate to `/test?secId=DEMO123`
3. Complete the test to see results
4. Login as admin and check "Test Results"
5. Use the sample data script to populate test data

## 💡 Customization

### Adding New Questions
Edit `src/lib/testData.ts` and add to the `sampleQuestions` array:

```typescript
{
  id: 11,
  question: "Your new question here?",
  options: ["A) Option 1", "B) Option 2", "C) Option 3", "D) Option 4"],
  correctAnswer: "B",
  category: "Your Category"
}
```

### Modifying Test Duration
Change `TEST_DURATION` in `src/pages/TestPage.tsx`:

```typescript
const TEST_DURATION = 20 * 60 // 20 minutes
```

### Customizing Pass Score
Modify the scoring logic in `src/lib/testData.ts` and admin dashboard filters.
